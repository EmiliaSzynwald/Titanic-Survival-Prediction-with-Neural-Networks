# Titanic Survival Prediction with Neural Networks

## Project Description

This project explores the use of artificial neural networks for supervised classification, specifically predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using the classic Kaggle Titanic dataset. The workflow includes data preprocessing (feature selection, normalization, and encoding), model building with PyTorch, and experimentation with different neural network architectures and hyperparameters to optimize predictive performance.

## Project Goals

- **Apply neural networks to a real-world binary classification problem.**
- **Select and preprocess relevant features using correlation analysis and removal of highly intercorrelated features.**
- **Normalize and split the dataset for robust model evaluation.**
- **Experiment with various neural network architectures (layers, neurons, optimizers) to find the best model.**
- **Evaluate and compare models using training and validation loss.**
- **Comment on model performance and learning outcomes.**

## Achievements

- Successfully loaded and preprocessed the Titanic dataset, including feature selection based on correlation and removal of highly intercorrelated features.
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables and normalized all features using standard scaling.
- Built and trained multiple neural network models in PyTorch, varying the number of layers, neurons, and optimization algorithms (SGD and Adam).
- Compared models using training and validation loss, identifying architectures that generalized well and avoided overfitting.
- Demonstrated that neural networks can effectively classify survival outcomes on the Titanic dataset, achieving meaningful predictive accuracy and providing insights into the impact of model architecture and hyperparameters on performance.
